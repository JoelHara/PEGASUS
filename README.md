# PEGASUS

PEGASUS is a powerful spying tool made by an Israeli company called NSO Group. It can secretly get into people's phones such as iPhones or Androids without them clicking on any emails or links. Once it’s in, it can read texts, listen to calls, turn on the camera or microphone, and track where someone is.
At first, the company said it was only for catching criminals and terrorists. But reports showed that it was also used by governments to spy on journalists, activists, and other people who weren’t doing anything wrong. That’s why it caused a lot of concern around the world.

The dataset that is being used, is showing the types of devices, operating system version as well as different protocols and IP addresses that may be at risk. Using Python, we were able to analyze the dataset to show which platforms are at risk to attacks. 

Questions:
-Which platform is more at risk of a pegasus attack?

-Which out of these four Operating systems are more likely to be targeted?

-Showing the protocols that have the most frequented attacks.

-Showing the precentage of attacks from Pegasus on certain source ips.

-Displaying the most frequented log type percentage on Pegasus.

The datasets used were found on Kaggle.com.
